## Description
A project born from my love for outdoor adventures and my desire to leverage technology to connect people to nature!

<b>The National Parks Explorer App</b> is your ultimate companion for exploring the breathtaking beauty of the United States national parks. This Android mobile application leverages the power of the Google Maps API and the National Park Service (NPS) API to provide you with a seamless and immersive experience in discovering the wonders of nature.

<b>Features</b>
